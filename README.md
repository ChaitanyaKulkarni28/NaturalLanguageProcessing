Assignment2 Q2
Program to compute the bigram model (counts and probabilities) on the given corpus 
(HW2_F17_NLP6320-NLPCorpusTreebank2Parts-CorpusA.txt)under the following three (3) scenarios:
i. No Smoothing
ii. Add-one Smoothing
iii. Good-Turing Discounting based Smoothing

Assignment2 Q3_Q1
Transformation-based POS Tagging: Implemented Brill’s transformation-based POS tagging algorithm using ONLY
the previous word’s tag to extract the best transformation rule to:
i. Transform “NN” to “JJ”
ii. Transform “NN” to “VB”

Assignment2 Q3_Q2
Program to compute the bigram models (counts and probabilities) required by the above Naïve Bayesian Classification formula.



HW #3

Implemented the Viterbi algorithm to compute the most likely weather sequence and probability for any given
observation sequence. Example observation sequences: 331, 122313, 331123312, etc.
